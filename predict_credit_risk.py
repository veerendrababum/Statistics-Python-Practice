Problem Statement: The original dataset contains 1000 entries with 20 categorial/symbolic attributes prepared by 
Prof. Hofmann. In this dataset, each entry represents a person who takes a credit by a bank. Each person is classified 
as good or bad credit risks according to the set of attributes. 

Goal: Predict the new customer belongs to good pr bad credit risk based on the features of the customers. 

Solution: Using machine learning classification technique we can build a best suitable model to classify the future
customer belongs to good or bad credit risks

# there is high possibility to get the lender amount back.

# Let see the distribution of Risk across Checking account
